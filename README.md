# Lets Paint

A painting site created using ES6 and HTML5 canvas.  
The basic canvas was created using [Wes Bos's JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) HTML5 canvas tutorial. Features such as changing the brush and background colour through HTML input elements on the page, and functionality such as undoing drawing actions, have later been added using ES6. 

Features include:
+ Changing brush colour
+ Changing the brush width
+ Changing the brush shape
+ Changing the brush colour effect (eg colour lightening where two colours overlap, or newer lines overlapping older lines)
+ Changing the background colour without overwriting the drawing
+ Undoing the latest drawing action (currently only works on the drawn lines, not the background colour)

Features to be added:
+ Ability to undo all previous actions (including background colour change)
+ Ability to revert undo actions ("redo")
+ Ability to save the finished work (drawing and background) into a file
